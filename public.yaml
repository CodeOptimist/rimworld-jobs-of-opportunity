intro: Vanilla's opportunistic hauling, only better. Although patched for compatibility, [i]While You're Up[/i] has not changed since 1.0 integrated it. This mod is a direct replacement and significant improvement. Compatible with existing saves. Any load order.

  [h1]Jobs Of Opportunity[/h1]
  A spiritual successor to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1544626521][i]kevlou's[/i] While You're Up[/url], which 1.0 integrated. This mod exposes vanilla's opportunistic hauling settings and improves upon them.

  As a performance optimization, vanilla requires a haulable be near your [b]start[/b] position, and its stockpile near your job. Too far and it won't be hauled, [i]even if it's directly in your path[/i]. We can do better.

  [h1]Background[/h1]
  I began with the intention to fork While You're Up, until I saw 1.0 had [i]fully[/i] integrated and improved it. Since it appears discontinued, and this in its spirit, I'm hoping to get away with carrying on the name <3.
  
  This mod's (now exposed) settings show how vanilla does opportunistic hauling. For those curious, While You're Up worked a little different:
  [i]Max total trip % of original trip[/i] of 1.5 (vanilla is 1.7).
  [i]Max start-to-thing % of original trip[/i] of 0.35 with a 2 minimum (vanilla is 0.5).
  Although tighter than vanilla's, the lack of a storage-to-job check gave his mod extra hauling opportunities even on 1.0, though it triggered on a shorter hardcoded list of jobs.
  Now that this check is merely [i]preferred[/i], and we have all the new job triggers, we have the best of both!

  - title: More hauling opportunities
    desc: |-
      By default prefers the proximity requirements set by vanilla, but loosens them to find valid haulables. Adjustable for optimal performance.

      desc: |-
        For performance reasons we don't calculate and sort all paths. Instead we check for good-enough. Extra loops through the haulables yields more optimal jobs. The stricter we are, the less opportunities.
        Although computations are cached, extra loops (→) [i]may[/i] lag large colonies (untested).

    steam: |-
      If you've ever seen your builder cross the map to retrieve a [i]single[/i] component.
    desc: |-
      If [i]and only if[/i] hauling a resource to storage would bring it closer to a blueprint, do that first.
      Haul jobs carry more materials, and with [i]Pick Up And Haul[/i], much more.
